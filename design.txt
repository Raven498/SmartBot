Problem Description:
A random number is chosen (either 2 or 4). There is an inital number. This initial number is continuously divided by either 2 or 4. The input will be the new number returned after division.

Objective: Find the Initial number
Pattern:
  - factors: [2, 4]
  - operation: /
  - input: Input from Problem
Input:
  - 1st run: Initial number
  - All other runs: Number returned from previous run

Analysis Threshold: Default (5)

SmartBot Algorithm (Assume the Pattern is already in its Solution Set):
Repeat until the Analysis Threshold is reached:
  Run the Problem
  Collect the Input returned by the Problem
  Add the Input to the Dataset
For each Solution in the Solution Set:
  For each Input in the Dataset:
    Evaluate the Solution for the Input
    At the second-to-last Input in the Dataset and the new Input equals the next Input?
      Return this Solution
    New Input equal to the next Input in the Dataset?
      Move on to the next Input
    Otherwise:
      Move on to the next Solution
Return null

Problem Algorithm:
When called, return an Input
When called, return an Acknowledgement
When called, return a Pattern
